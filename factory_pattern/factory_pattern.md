# Factory Design Pattern

The Factory Design Pattern is one of the creational design patterns. It provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful when the exact type of object needs to be determined during runtime rather than compile time.

## Basics

### Problem Statement

Suppose you have a class with a lot of subclasses, and you need to instantiate one of these subclasses based on some input. The naive approach is to use conditional statements to determine which class to instantiate. This can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and extend.

### Solution

The Factory Design Pattern suggests defining a separate method for creating objects, which can be overridden by subclasses to create specific types of objects.

## Basic Implementation

Let's start with a basic example to illustrate the Factory Design Pattern.

### Example Scenario

Imagine we have a system that handles different types of notifications: `EmailNotification` and `SMSNotification`.

## Advanced Concepts

### Abstract Factory Pattern

When you need multiple factories to create a family of related objects, you can use the Abstract Factory Pattern. This pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Parameterization

The factory method can be parameterized to allow more flexible object creation.

### Configuration-based Factory

Instead of hardcoding the type in the factory method, you can use configuration files or environment variables to determine the object type at runtime.

## Advanced Implementation

Let's enhance our example to include an abstract factory.

### Abstract Factory Example

Imagine we now have two types of notification factories: `BasicNotificationFactory` and `PremiumNotificationFactory`.

## Summary

- **Basic Factory Pattern**: Encapsulates the creation of objects.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Encapsulates a group of factories.
- **Use Cases**: When the creation process is complex, involves multiple steps, or the type of object needs to be decided at runtime.
